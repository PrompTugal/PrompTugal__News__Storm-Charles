# The accounts: what this project costs

This is the cost of running the site, not news of the storm, and not a warning service: for warnings read [IPMA](https://www.ipma.pt/) and the authorities. Three kinds of figure, never mixed: **measured** (counted from a ledger, a transcript or a run), **reported** (another desk's own statement), **estimated** (our arithmetic, with its reasons). A cell with no figure says *not measured*; nothing is guessed. Tokens are not converted to money: no price is applied to an agent's session. Where the savings are: [savings](savings.md). The latest brief for Dinis: [2026-11-11T1942Z](briefs/2026-11-11T1942Z.md).

## The books at a glance

| | Figure | Kind | Source, read |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model spend today | **1.06 of 20 US dollars** (5.3% of the cap) | measured 0.87 + reported 0.19 | [models.json](models.json), from [the model ledger's summary](../models/ledger-summary.json), 11 November, 03:06 UTC |
| The provider's account | **out of credit: every call refused with HTTP 402 since 02:55 UTC**: credits 165, used 165.33 US dollars (the account serves more than this project) | reported by the provider | [provider.json](provider.json), from [incident.models@'s status](../agents/models/status.json), 11 November, 02:57 UTC |
| Agent sessions measured | **30 of 41** | measured | [agents.json](agents.json), 11 November, 19:42 UTC |
| Tokens, measured sessions | **3,210,881,311** in all, 3,168,609,797 of them cache reads (98.7%) | measured | [the ledger lines](ledger/) |
| Most expensive hour, models | 02:00 UTC: 0.87 US dollars, 4,922 calls | measured | [models.json](models.json) |
| Most expensive hour, tokens | 02:00 UTC: 657,577,281 tokens (27 measured agents) | measured | [agents.json](agents.json) |
| Busiest hour, CI | 02:00 UTC: 171 runs, 1,932 s | measured | [machine.json](machine.json), from [incident.ci@'s runs](../data/ci/index.json), 11 November, 19:18 UTC |
| CI | 1,469 runs, 1,055 releases, 26,009 s of runner time | measured | the same |
| Repository | 3,211 files tracked, 32.6 MB; 2,490 pages built | measured | [machine.json](machine.json), 11 November, 19:42 UTC |

The cap: 20 US dollars a day since 02:50 UTC on 11 November (5 before), [Dinis's words in the brief](../BRIEF.md).

## Cost per output

Only where both sides are measured. An agent does more than one thing in a session, so tokens per output are an upper bound.

| Output | Count | Cost each | Kind | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| timeline row | 133 | 917,610 weighted tokens | measured tokens over a measured count | [data/signals.json](../incidents/2026-11-10-storm-charles/data/signals.json) |
| story | 7 | 1,399,311 weighted tokens | measured tokens over a measured count | [stories/*/story.json](../stories/) |
| captured page | 634 | 14,866 weighted tokens | measured tokens over a measured count | [evidence/index.json](../evidence/index.json) |
| release (a successful CI run) | 1,055 | 24.4 s of CI; tokens not measured: 30 of 41 agents have measured: the team's tokens per release need all of them | measured | [data/ci/runs/*.json](../data/ci/runs/) |
| model call through the ledger | 4,927 | 0.0002 US dollars | measured | [models/ledger-summary.json](../models/ledger-summary.json) |

Weighted tokens: fresh input + output + cache writes + a tenth of cache reads (an estimate of relative cost from WS-148, not a price). File: [outputs.json](outputs.json).

## Tokens by agent

Each agent measures its own session with [tools/accounts-measure.mjs](../tools/accounts-measure.mjs) (the method of WS-148: one line of numbers, no message text) and commits the line. The latest line of each session counts.

The method is WS-148's (an accountant agent: every agent measures its tokens, the accountant finds the savings) from [web-summit.sgit.ai](https://web-summit.sgit.ai).
